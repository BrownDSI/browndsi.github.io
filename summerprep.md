## Live sessions

### Logistics

Starting on Thursday, May 28 at 12 PM noon Eastern Time, we'll begin holding live sessions to review content from [Data Gymnasia](https://mathigon.org/data-gymnasia).

### Content 

For the first session, we will treat the first four sections of the [Data Science Pipeline course](https://mathigon.org/course/intro-data-pipeline/introduction). 

We recommend that you work through those sections prior to class, but you are welcome to participate whether you do or not. If you don't have experience with Python, or if you want a refresher, you might also complete some of the sections in the [Intro to Python course](https://mathigon.org/course/programming-in-python/introduction).

Please sign up for Mathigon with my teacher code, which I will email to you. You can join the class by using the code when signing up for Mathigon. If you already have an account, you can click “Add Class Code” in the sidebar of their student dashboard.

### Babylon House

The class session will be facilitated using Babylon House; please go ahead and join the BH class [here](https://babylon.house/projects/a5543fce-71d1-4256-89cd-70845ee2cafb/join)
