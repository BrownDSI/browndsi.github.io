## Day 1

On April 21 at 4 PM, we held a video tutorial session with 154 participants for those in the Brown community and beyond. We used Pandas to explore one of the most popular COVID-19 data sets, and we discussed some approaches to prediction. 

We used a platform called [Babylon House](https://babylon.house) to enable interactivity via chat. A Google Colab notebook with the Babylon House script and code, as well as the video recording, are available here:

* [Video](https://brown.zoom.us/rec/share/zMpoEeqs819LS9LTwnr9B7wfO47Ceaa80SdM_vJfnxtqiFmaeXLS4EHr7dF7PYdR)

A Brown login is required to watch the video, but the Colab notebook is recommended as the more efficient source anyway.

## Day 2

On 12 PM on Friday, June 5, we discussed methods for estimating the crucially important quantity Rₜ (the average number of new infections generated by each infectious individual, at time t).

## Day 3

Next time, **Friday, June 19 at 12 PM**, we'll continue our discussion of Rₜ estimation (though we will develop the content in a way which facilitates participation for those who didn't attend Day 2). 

The Babylon House [link](https://babylon.house/projects/9282c066-ff77-46d2-8a63-394af6ff5105/join) is the same as for the previous meetings, and the Zoom link is [here](https://brown.zoom.us/j/99191779389).
