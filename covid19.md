On April 21 at 4 PM, we held a video tutorial session with 154 participants for those in the Brown community and beyond. We used Pandas to explore one of the most popular COVID-19 data sets, and we discussed some approaches to prediction. 

We used a platform called [Babylon House](https://babylon.house) to enable interactivity via chat. A Google Colab notebook with the Babylon House script and code, as well as the video recording, are available here:

* [Video](https://brown.zoom.us/rec/share/zMpoEeqs819LS9LTwnr9B7wfO47Ceaa80SdM_vJfnxtqiFmaeXLS4EHr7dF7PYdR)

A Brown login is required to watch the video, but the Colab notebook is recommended as the more efficient source anyway.
