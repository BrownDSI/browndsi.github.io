## Day 1

On April 21 at 4 PM, we held a video tutorial session with 154 participants for those in the Brown community and beyond. We used Pandas to explore one of the most popular COVID-19 data sets, and we discussed some approaches to prediction. 

We used a platform called [Babylon House](https://babylon.house) to enable interactivity via chat. A Google Colab notebook with the Babylon House script and code, as well as the video recording, are available here: 

* [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12IyckouU_Mqr9x5uTNvFyVuJ2ZGO5g9m)  
* [Video](https://brown.zoom.us/rec/share/zMpoEeqs819LS9LTwnr9B7wfO47Ceaa80SdM_vJfnxtqiFmaeXLS4EHr7dF7PYdR)

A Brown login is required to watch the video, but the Colab notebook is recommended as the more efficient source anyway.

## Day 2

Next time (12 PM on Friday, May 29), we'll explore methods for estimating the crucially important quantity Râ‚œ(the average number of new infections generated by each infectious individual, at time t). 

Here's the [Zoom link](https://brown.zoom.us/j/91357528021) and the [Babylon House link](https://babylon.house/projects/9282c066-ff77-46d2-8a63-394af6ff5105/join).
