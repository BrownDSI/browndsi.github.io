#### Course Overview
 
This course provides a modern introduction to inferential methods for regression analysis and statistical learning, with an emphasis on application of the methods in practical settings. Regression methods are developed in the context of learning relationships from observed data. Methods include basics of linear regression, variable selection and dimension reduction, and approaches to nonlinear regression such as polynomial regression, spline-based methods, and generalized additive models. Extensions to multilevel data structures such as clustered and longitudinal data are also described. Fundamentals of causal inference are introduced, together with statistical methods for inferring causal relationships in different study designs.
